Just, well, totally different. Sure, like a sales advisor you'll serve customers, fill up the shelves and keep the whole place looking spick and span. But this is anything but your everyday retail role.</p>\n<p>\nHere, you'll talk confidently with customers, giving them the advice they need to live healthier, happier lives. And we'll make sure you're ready for whatever question, query or lifestyle goal is thrown your way. If you want to go on and specialise in sports, nutrition, beauty or aromatherapy, we can help you to do that too.</p>\n<p>\n The training can be pretty full on \u2013 but it's totally worth it. You'll learn how the human body works. You'll get to know vitamins and supplements inside out. And you'll develop the skills you need to flourish. Be it dietary advice, aches and pains, or a customer wanting to polish up their guns, you'll know just what to do. You will be responsible for the opening and closing of the store from time to time to assist with the smooth operation of trading</p>\n<p>\n It's challenging. It's hard work. And it's certainly not for the faint hearted. But if the idea of a career in health and wellbeing (and a life of helping customers in their pursuit of health and happiness) gives you that warm-fuzzy-feeling inside, there's a unique experience here for the taking.</p>\n<p>\nWhen it comes to specialist health and wellbeing retailers, we're number one. The biggest in Europe. We've over 1,000 stores (and more on the way) in almost every major city and town across the UK and Ireland \u2013 not to mention more than 80 stores around the world too. It's big scale stuff.

With the Army Reserve, you'll get to do something different with your time. Learn new skills, make friends and get paid too.</p><p>WHAT IS THE ARMY RESERVE? - Army Reserve soldiers (Reservists) get involved in everything that the Regular Army does - from combat to peacekeeping and humanitarian work. They are given the opportunity to learn trade skills and can take advantage of the opportunities that Regular soldiers have too - like adventurous training. They are paid for the time they spend.</p><p>The difference is that Reservists are not full-time soldiers. Many Reservists have a day job.</p><p>LIFE IN THE ARMY RESERVE - Once you've joined, most Reservists serve near their home, and meet once a week to train. You'll have occasional weekends away on exercise or adventurous training.</p><p>There's also a two-week training camp that you'll go on, to put your skills into practice. You may be asked to go on operations if needed, but we will make sure that you're fully trained for the task in hand.</p><p>TRAINING TO BE A RESERVIST - As a Reservist, you do your training in the evenings and at weekends and you get paid for the time you spend training. You'll need to do your basic training - but this can be arranged to fit in around your day job. You don't have to do all the training at once. It can be completed in shorter modules or in one go.</p><p>Further training also takes place in your spare time. It can take weeks or months depending on your role, course and how much time you can give. Your unit will be happy to support you during your training.</p><p>HOW MUCH TIME WILL IT TAKE? - How much time you spend is really up to you - training is flexible and can fit around your life. Most roles will ask you to aim for 27 days a year - and your weekly training session at your unit will count towards this. To earn your annual bonus, you'll need to make sure you meet your time commitment.</p><p>BENEFITS FOR RESERVISTS - As a Reservist soldier, you'll be paid a day rate which is in line with Regular soldier pay. You can also earn a 'bounty' which is a tax-free sum, and there are financial packages available to some people looking to join the Army Reserve. You'll also be enrolled into the Armed Forces Pension Scheme.</p><p>New Entrant Daily Pay - \u00a340.12</p><p>Soldier Daily Pay - \u00a351.21</p><p>Bounty pay varies from \u00a3470 in year 1 to \u00a31,862 in year 5.</p><p>It's not just about the money, you'll learn soldiering skills, but you'll also get the chance to develop more specialist skills - these could lead to gaining extra qualifications which will count outside the Army too.</p><p>We have the following roles available within this unit;</p><p>* LIGHT GUNNER - Become a highly skilled Gunner and make a big difference on the battlefield. Get qualifications, make friends for life and enjoy an exciting Army life.</p><p>http://apply.army.mod.uk/roles/royal-artillery/gunner-light-gunner</p><p>* ARTILLERY COMMAND SYSTEMS - Use the latest systems to get crucial information to troops.

We are offering a varied, fulfilling, and exciting role that will see you being able to build great rapport with your clients and good case continuity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt Celyn Vet Group, we are passionate about case continuity. This means that from the moment our vets see their patients, they are encouraged to investigate and work up their own cases from that initial visit onwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also have a wide and varying case load, which means our vets are able to undertake a mixture of consulting and surgical days each week. These are usually set days each week so that our vets can also book in their own surgical cases to carry out.</div>\n<h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>About Us</b></h3>\n<p>Celyn Vet Group have two, well-established veterinary practices in Holywell and Prestatyn and offer high standards of first opinion care to small animals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe really do value our team here at Celyn Vet Group and all of their hard work. We all pull together and support each other in the harder times and really are more like a family than co-workers. We are a team of 18 consisting of: 3 vets (one of which is our Clinical Director), Practice Manager, 2 senior nurses, 3 RVN's, 3 SVN's, 1 senior receptionist, 4 receptionists and 1 Groomer.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only are we blessed to have such a great team, but we also have a fantastic, loyal client base. We often see returning client\u2019s throughout the years meaning we get to care for our patients from puppies/ kittens to seniors. We are passionate on preventative health care and nutrition. We mainly care for small animals and wildlife, offering high standard of first opinion care. This role would be great for a Surgeon with a strong GP interest, looking for a long term role, in an easy going practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvesting in our practice, patient care and team is important to us. We would therefore be really keen to support your expertise or learning goals and incorporate them into the services for the practice potentially. Both practices benefit from in-house blood and lab facilities for routine work, ultrasound and x-ray facilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are situated in the beautiful area of North Wales. Being close to the border and the A55, it means we are well located for those who enjoy the more rural side of life, with plenty of countryside and hill walk areas, or those that prefer the city environment with Chester, Liverpool and Manchester situated not far away from us.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>Applicant Requirements</b></h3>\n<p>The ideal candidate would enjoy general practice and feel comfortable with all first opinion procedures. You will be supported and encouraged to work to high medical and surgical standards. You must be RCVS registered. A UK driving license would be required to commute between our sites.</p>\n<p>As a BAME and LGBT+ inclusive employer, we are keen to hear from candidates from all minority and diverse groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a Disability Confident Employer we are keen to hear from candidates with disabilities and long term health conditions, and would be happy to discuss any reasonable adjustments needed during the recruitment process.</p></div><br/>\n<p></p>\n<p></p><div><h2 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nAny questions before applying?</b></h2><p>\nSpeak to Amy Cranfield from our recruitment team who would be happy to help you with any questions you have before applying for this role.</p><div><div><h3 class=\"jobSectionHeader\"><b>\nAmy Cranfield</b></h3><p>\nVeterinary Recruitment Consultant</p>\namy.cranfield@ivcevidensia.com07856426902</div></div></div></div><p></p></div>",

You will encounter learners with mixed ability levels and so a flexible, friendly and patient approach to teaching is key. Most of all, you will have a passion for your subject and a desire for the learners in your care to succeed.\n<br/><br/>\nCER are an established education recruitment agency, with over 20 years' experience in the primary, secondary and SEN sectors, with many schools working with us on an exclusive supply basis, meaning we can unlock doors that other agencies can't open for you. This is what 'divides' us from our competitors.\n<br/><br/>\nWhen you join us you can expect access to 'outstanding' CPD training to develop your skillset, competitive rates of pay and a dedicated specialist secondary consultant with close relationships to the major secondary schools in the West Yorkshire and the surrounding areas who will work tirelessly to match your experience and specialisms within English to the right role for you. We offer both flexible working for those looking for part-time roles and full-time English teacher roles for those looking for a more long-term opportunity.\n<br/><br/>\nIf you feel you are a English teacher with the relevant skills, experience and passion, we would love to hear from you by applying to this advert or calling 0191 244 2600 and asking for Chris Mahon (bonus points for the correct pronunciation!).\n<br/><br/>\nI look forward to hearing from you soon!\n<br/><br/>\n#CERSHUB</div>",
