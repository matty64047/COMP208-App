You will encounter learners with mixed ability levels and so a flexible, friendly and patient approach to teaching is key. Most of all, you will have a passion for your subject and a desire for the learners in your care to succeed.\n<br/><br/>\nCER are an established education recruitment agency, with over 20 years' experience in the primary, secondary and SEN sectors, with many schools working with us on an exclusive supply basis, meaning we can unlock doors that other agencies can't open for you. This is what 'divides' us from our competitors.\n<br/><br/>\nWhen you join us you can expect access to 'outstanding' CPD training to develop your skillset, competitive rates of pay and a dedicated specialist secondary consultant with close relationships to the major secondary schools in the Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield and surrounding areas who will work tirelessly to match your experience and specialisms within Science to the right role for you. We offer both flexible working for those looking for part-time roles and full-time Science teacher roles for those looking for a more long-term opportunity.\n<br/><br/>\nIf you are sick of 'experimenting' finding the right school for you, and you possess the relevant skills, experience and passion, we would love to hear from you by applying to this advert or calling 0191 244 2600 and asking for Chris Mahon (bonus points for the correct pronunciation!).\n<br/><br/>\nI look forward to hearing from you soon!\n<br/><br/>\n#CERSHUB</div>", "company":"CER Education Recruitment", "location":"England", "days_ago":"5 days ago", "image":"https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_headerimage/3404c58dc605b766c78eca38d5c26ee4", "logo":"https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/cec8f2d774ad60b86fedbfca553190be", "work_type":"Temporary", "university":"Liverpool", "added":"2021-04-11 23:31:16"},
